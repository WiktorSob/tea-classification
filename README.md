# About

This project is focused on creating a model for recognizing type of tea based on pictures. This project implements few different approaches:

* Classic models (SVM, Logistic regression) based on data obtained from histograms of picures

* Classic models based on PCA obtained from histograms

* CNN on quanized images

* Mulitlayer Neural Network based on histograms

* Multilayer Neural Network based on PCA from histograms
